### Direct School Admission (DSA)

DSA-Sec provides all Primary 6 students with an opportunity to go into a secondary school, based on their non-academic achievements and talents. There are different DSA-Sec Categories e.g CCAs, Talent-specific. DSA-Sec allows students to grow their talents through the school programmes offered. Each participating school offers distinctive programme and sets its own selection process and criteria to admit students with talents that can be further developed by their programmes.

You may consider applying for your child a secondary school through DSA-Sec if you are able to identify a school that offers a talent development programme to help develop your childâ€™s area of strength. E.g In his/her current CCA. You can find out more in the slides below on how our students are supported before and during their E-interviews/Trials by the secondary schools.
