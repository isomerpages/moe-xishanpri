# **Student iCON**

### Onboarding Student iCON

To further support and enhance learning, Xishanites will now have an additional online learning platform to different learning needs. In addition to our Student Learning Space (SLS), MOE has provisioned Student iCON for students to facilitate collaboration as well as teaching and learning among teachers and students. Student iCON will be based on Google Suite for Education. Student iCON includes an email account, Google Apps and Google classroom. Our Xishanites will be briefed this week on how to activate their accounts.
