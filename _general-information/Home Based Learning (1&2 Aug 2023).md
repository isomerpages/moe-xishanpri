#### Home-based Learning (HBL) Plan and Support for Primary 1 to 5 Students (1 and 2 August 2023)

1.      As mentioned in the earlier letter to parents on the calendar of events in Term 3 (Reference Number: LTP/2023/101), the school will be conducting the Primary 6 Preliminary Oral Examination on **1 and 2 August** (Tuesday and Wednesday). As such, all Primary 1 to 5 students will NOT be reporting to school and will be involved in HBL during the two days.

2.      As part of the school’s effort to engage your child/ward in learning during the HBL on 1 and 2 August, home-based learning materials and assignments have been prepared and will be disseminated to our students. These learning resources and their content coverage for each subject are aligned to each department’s scheme of work and students will continue to learn these topics through various learning tasks and activities.

3.      The HBL will focus on English, Mathematics, Mother Tongue languages and Science, and there will not be any online work assigned. To facilitate students’ learning during the HBL, these assignments will be given from Friday, 28 July 2023 for students to complete on 1 and 2 August.

4.      The school will also be sending to parents, via Parents Gateway, a daily HBL plan on the learning for the two HBL days detailing the learning tasks, materials that their child/ward will need and the contact of teachers whom parents may wish to contact for assistance. This HBL plan will be useful in helping parents to facilitate the learning of their child/ward at home.

5.      If your child/ward is unable to engage the HBL and complete the assignments, please **inform your child’s/ward’s Form Teacher** so that alternative arrangements can be made to provide support for his/her learning.
