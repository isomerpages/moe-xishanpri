# **Appreciation and Feedback**

Your words of appreciation will serve as an encouragement, motivation and positive affirmation of the good work of the Xishan Staff.

Showing your appreciation, gratitude or even saying thank you is really easy and anyone can do it, whether you’re a pupil, a parent, an ex-pupil, an Alumni member of the school, someone who had the opportunity to work with any of the Xishan Staff or even a colleague of the Xishan staff!

If you would like to express appreciation or provide feedback you may email us directly to [xishan_ps@moe.edu.sg](mailto:xishan_ps@moe.edu.sg).
