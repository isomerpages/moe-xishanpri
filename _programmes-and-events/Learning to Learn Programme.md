<h1><strong>Learning to Learn Programme</strong></h1>
<h3>Learning to Learn Programme Objectives</h3>
<p>The future is what we do in the present. The Xishan education experience
not only focuses on equipping our learners with the knowledge, skills and
dispositions to help them achieve but also emphasises on the well-being
of every student. Other than providing rich opportunities for our students
to immerse in the joy of learning, the school recognises the importance
of growing the metacognitive domain to help every child learn to learn.</p>
<h3>Learning to Learn Programme Highlights</h3>
<p>To facilitate effective learning, the school endeavours to imbue in our
students the passion to learn. To do this, the school firmly believes that
it is hence key to help students develop a language of learning. The Learning
to Learn programme aspires to equip our learners with a common language
for learning anchored on a set of key learning principles. These core principles
are fundamental to students subsequently devising learning strategies that
will eventually serve them so as to become not only effective learners
but also lifelong learners as well.</p>
