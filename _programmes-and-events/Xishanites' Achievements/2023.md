A group of students, Kiersten Yeo, Krystabelle Zhu, Tan Xu Hao, Claire Lai, Liong Yuan Xi and Nur Asyalina Risqin, took part in Green Wave Environmental Care Competition 2022 which was organised by Sembcorp Marine. Their project focused on food waste management, where a food sorting and composting bin was designed to encourage the community (HDB households, school canteen vendors) to upcycle food waste into compost.

We are pleased to announce that their project has won the Encouragement Award. One of the team members, Kiersten, was awarded the Good Presenter Award. Congratulations to the team!
