In 2023, Xishan achieved 1 Gold, 7 Silver and 16 Bronze awards in the SASMO competition and was placed 3rd in the River Valley High Mathematics Challenge.




####  Science PinnaCle Challenge

To further cultivate the spirit of creative and critical thinking among our Xishanites beyond the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), our P6 students were enthusiastically engaged in the Pei Hwa Secondary School’s PinnaCle Challenge. The challenge was to conceptualize an environmentally conscious candy coating, inspired by pharmaceutical capsules, using exclusively sustainable, renewable, and biodegradable materials. As a testament to their ingenuity, we proudly secured the 1st Prize in the Science Challenge category.
