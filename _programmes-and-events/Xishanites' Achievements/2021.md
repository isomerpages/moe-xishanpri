### UPLIFT Programme

Our school was featured on Channel 8 News yesterday. Being part of the UPLIFT (Uplifting Pupils in Life and Inspiring Families Taskforce) programme, Xishan Primary School provides a space safe and conducive, with carefully curated activities for students after school. Students get to spend their time more meaningfully after school by participating in these activities.

Our students, who are in this programme, are becoming more motivated and resilient. They no longer give up easily. Haider, one of our students who is involved in the programme, mentioned that instead of being at home all alone, he now could spend his time more productively after school to complete his work and learn new skills at the same time.

Mrs Quek is happy to share the encouraging outcomes from the programme. She is most inspired by the improvements made by the students in terms of their confidence and resilience. The Xishan family will continue to work together to develop thriving and confident Xishanites!

### Use Of ICT Tools To Promote Interest In Learning Mother Tongue 2021

Our Chinese Department offers a variety of language and cultural activities to engage the students actively in the learning of Chinese. We are pleased to share that our HOD Mother Tongue, Mdm Tan Chiu Lin, was recently featured in Lianhe Zaobao on 21 Feb 2021 for her passion in instilling joy and promoting interest in the learning of Chinese. Through joy of learning, many students develop strong interest in their Mother Tongue. They are given the opportunity to take up Higher Chinese at Primary five level to realise their potential.

### Learning Difficulty Helps Graduand Better Understand, Connect With Students

We would like to congratulate our teacher, Ms Kleinman who was recently featured on Channel News Asia and in Lianhe Zao Bao for her creative teaching tools used in her English and Social Studies lessons.

She is a role model of resilience. Through overcoming a learning difficulty as a child, she understands that each child is unique and learns in various ways. From her personal experience, she tries to engage her students using innovative and fun educational strategies, such as incorporating puppetry and songs, into her lessons. Her educational philosophy is to live out and impart her educational mission, “Always learning in heart and mind.” She is an inspiration to our students.
