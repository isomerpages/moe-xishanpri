### UPLIFT Programme

Our school was featured on Channel 8 News yesterday. Being part of the UPLIFT (Uplifting Pupils in Life and Inspiring Families Taskforce) programme, Xishan Primary School provides a space safe and conducive, with carefully curated activities for students after school. Students get to spend their time more meaningfully after school by participating in these activities.

Our students, who are in this programme, are becoming more motivated and resilient. They no longer give up easily. Haider, one of our students who is involved in the programme, mentioned that instead of being at home all alone, he now could spend his time more productively after school to complete his work and learn new skills at the same time.

Mrs Quek is happy to share the encouraging outcomes from the programme. She is most inspired by the improvements made by the students in terms of their confidence and resilience. The Xishan family will continue to work together to develop thriving and confident Xishanites!
