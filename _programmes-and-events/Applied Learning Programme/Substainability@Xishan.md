Everyone has a right to live in a safe, clean, and healthy environment. At Xishan Primary, we develop [sustainability education](https://go.gov.sg/alpsubstainability2023)  by engaging students in the shaping and provision of essentials to future generations while preserving the environment through our ALP programmes and collaboration with the Green Movement Committee.
