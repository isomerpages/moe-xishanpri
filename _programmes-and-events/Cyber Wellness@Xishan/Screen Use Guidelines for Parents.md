<h3>Grow Well SG: Screen Use Guidelines for Primary School Children</h3>
<p>As children become more adept with technology, guiding them towards healthy
and purposeful screen use is an important aspect of their development.
Under the <strong>Grow Well SG</strong> initiative, <strong>MOH</strong>,
together with <strong>MOE</strong> and <strong>MSF</strong>, has provided
updated recommendations to support the well-being of children in the digital
age, including guidance for those aged <strong>7–12 years.</strong>
</p>
<p>The information below complements the national guidelines and outlines
practical approaches for families to support healthy screen habits at home.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>		<strong>Screen Use Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>The infographic below from the <strong>Health Promotion Board (HPB)</strong> summarises
the key recommended practices for healthy screen use in children, including
those aged 7–12 years.</p>

<p>These guidelines are based on extensive research conducted by MOH, which
you can access by downloading the full report [here].</p>
<p><strong>2.	Supporting Healthy Screen Habits at Home</strong>
</p>
<p>To complement the guidance in the infographic, families may find the following
approaches helpful:</p>
<p><strong>a)	Be mindful of overall screen duration</strong>
</p>
<p>• Recreational screen use for children aged<strong> 7–12 years</strong> should
be <strong>kept to less than 2 hours a day,</strong> excluding school-related
learning.</p>
<p>• Encourage breaks to avoid long, continuous screen use.</p>
<p><strong>b)	Establish simple daily routines</strong>
</p>
<p>• Use devices at predictable times (e.g., after homework).</p>
<p>• Keep the hour before bedtime screen-free.</p>
<p>• Ensure time each day for physical activity, reading and rest.</p>
<p><strong>c)	Create screen-free moments</strong>
</p>
<p>• Maintain screen-free mealtimes.</p>
<p>• Keep devices out of bedrooms at night.</p>
<p><strong>d)	Be involved in your child’s digital world</strong>
</p>
<p>• Know what your child is watching or playing.</p>
<p>• Discuss online safety, respectful communication and what to do if they
encounter inappropriate content.</p>
<p><strong>e)	Use parental controls</strong>
</p>
<p>Parents may find it helpful to set basic safeguards on devices:</p>
<p>•	<strong>Apple devices (iPhone/iPad):</strong> Screen Time and Family Sharing
(<em>Family Sharing - Apple (SG</em>)</p>
<p>•	<strong>Android devices:</strong> Google Family Link (<em>Get started with Family Link - Google For Families Help</em>)</p>
<p>•	<strong>Windows computers:</strong> Microsoft Family Safety (<em>Set up Microsoft Family Safety - Microsoft Support</em>)</p>
<p>These tools help families ensure that device use stays age-appropriate
and well-regulated.</p>
<p><strong>3.	When to Review Screen Use</strong>
</p>
<p>Parents may wish to review their family’s expectations if they observe:</p>
<p>• Persistent difficulty stopping device use</p>
<p>• Irritability when devices are unavailable</p>
<p>• Loss of interest in non-screen activities</p>
<p>• Sleep disruption linked to screen use</p>
<p>If concerns persist, parents may contact the <strong>Form Teacher, Year Head</strong> or <strong>School Counsellor</strong>,
or consult a healthcare professional.</p>
