<h3><strong>XPS ICT Acceptable Use Policy</strong> For Parents and Guardians</h3>
<p>Xishan Primary School believes in leveraging technology to enhance students'
learning and development of their 21st Century Competencies. To ensure
a safe and conducive online learning experience for our students, they
are expected to abide by the following guidelines when using any technology
devices in school.</p>
<h3><strong>General Guidelines</strong></h3>
<p>1. Students should not attempt to access data, systems and information
that they are not authorised to access.</p>
<p>2. Learning devices and school's EdTech resources are to be used solely
for the purpose of learning and research.</p>
<p>3. Students may only use the accounts and passwords assigned to them and
should not share them with anyone else.</p>
<h3><strong>Being a Responsible Digital Citizen</strong> </h3>
<p>4. Students are expected to be kind and respectful when talking or working
with others online, including in group chats. They should not purposefully
exclude others or engage in unkind behaviour. Online remarks that are racially
and/or religiously insensitive, vulgar and/or offensive, or hurtful to
others are not permitted. Students should understand that once they post
something online, even in private chats, they may not be able to control
how it is shared.</p>
<p>5. Devices should not be used to access inappropriate information, content,
ads or any material that is not suitable for students' age or school environment.
Students are not permitted to store, modify, create or share inappropriate
content such as documents, presentations, pictures and videos that are
indecent, pornographic, defamatory, or hurtful to self or others. Additionally,
students must not make threats, cause harassment or embarrassment, impersonate
or intimidate others.</p>
<p>6. MOE/school-deployed ICT system accounts are not to be used for any
commercial activities (e.g. buying and selling of goods and services).</p>
<p>7. Students should understand that social media platforms like Instagram,
TikTok, Facebook, and others have minimum age requirements (typically 13
years and above) to protect younger users. Creating accounts on these platforms
is only permitted once students meet the age requirements and have discussed
it with their parents/guardians.</p>
