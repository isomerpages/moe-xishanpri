<h3><strong>XPS ICT Acceptable Use Policy</strong> For Parents and Guardians</h3>
<p>Xishan Primary School believes in leveraging technology to enhance students'
learning and development of their 21st Century Competencies. To ensure
a safe and conducive online learning experience for our students, they
are expected to abide by the following guidelines when using any technology
devices in school.</p>
<h3><strong>General Guidelines</strong></h3>
<p>1. Students should not attempt to access data, systems and information
that they are not authorised to access.</p>
<p>2. Learning devices and school's EdTech resources are to be used solely
for the purpose of learning and research.</p>
<p>3. Students may only use the accounts and passwords assigned to them and
should not share them with anyone else.</p>
<h3><strong>Being a Responsible Digital Citizen</strong></h3>
<p>4. Students are expected to be kind and respectful when talking or working
with others online, including in group chats. They should not purposefully
exclude others or engage in unkind behaviour. Online remarks that are racially
and/or religiously insensitive, vulgar and/or offensive, or hurtful to
others are not permitted. Students should understand that once they post
something online, even in private chats, they may not be able to control
how it is shared.</p>
<p>5. Devices should not be used to access inappropriate information, content,
ads or any material that is not suitable for students' age or school environment.
Students are not permitted to store, modify, create or share inappropriate
content such as documents, presentations, pictures and videos that are
indecent, pornographic, defamatory, or hurtful to self or others. Additionally,
students must not make threats, cause harassment or embarrassment, impersonate
or intimidate others.</p>
<p>6. MOE/school-deployed ICT system accounts are not to be used for any
commercial activities (e.g. buying and selling of goods and services).</p>
<p>7. Students should understand that social media platforms like Instagram,
TikTok, Facebook, and others have minimum age requirements (typically 13
years and above) to protect younger users. Creating accounts on these platforms
is only permitted once students meet the age requirements and have discussed
it with their parents/guardians.</p>
<h3><strong>Respecting Copyright </strong></h3>
<p>8. Explicit permission from content owner(s) is required before downloading,
copying or sharing any copyrighted materials (e.g. pictures, videos, music).</p>
<p>9. Digital files should not be used, copied, edited or shared in an unauthorised
or illegal manner.</p>
<h3><strong>Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) </strong></h3>
<p>10. Students should ensure that they meet the minimum age requirement
specified in each AI tool's age restrictions before using it.</p>
<p>11. When AI use is permitted, students are required to acknowledge the
use of AI in weighted assessments and homework as specified.</p>
<p>12. Students are expected to practice academic integrity and take responsibility
for their own learning when using AI. It is important for students to understand
that they are ultimately short-changing themselves if they pass off others’
work as their own.</p>
<h3><strong>Staying Safe and Secure Online </strong></h3>
<p>13. Any incidents (e.g. unusual device behaviour or inappropriate use
of devices) should be reported to the school.</p>
<p>14. Students are encouraged to develop online safety habits. This includes:</p>
<p>• not disclosing personal access credentials (e.g. MIMS password etc.)</p>
<p>• avoiding sharing sensitive personal data (e.g. home address, email address,
phone numbers, account IDs, passwords, or personal pictures) online, on
AI platforms, or with anyone</p>
<p>• verifying credibility and accuracy of online content before sharing</p>
<p>• avoiding clicking on suspicious links or downloading unknown files</p>
<p>• being cautious when interacting with others online (e.g. on social media)
by not engaging with strangers</p>
<p>• protecting themselves from online scams by being careful about deals
that seem too good to be true.</p>
<p>15. Students should exercise caution regarding the limitations of AI tools,
including potential inaccuracies/fabricated responses, inherent biases
and outdated information.</p>
<p>16. Students should be aware that online platforms (like YouTube, games,
or websites) show them content based on what they've viewed before. We
encourage students to discuss any concerning content with trusted adults.</p>
<p>17. Students are encouraged to think carefully before following online
trends and to set healthy boundaries on device use so that they can focus
on being present with the people around them.</p>
<h3><strong>Digital Wellbeing and Balance</strong> </h3>
<p>18. Students should balance screen time with other meaningful activities,
including physical exercise, outdoor play, and face-to-face interactions
with family and friends.</p>
<p>19. Outside of schoolwork, students should limit recreational screen time
and follow healthy screen-use habits appropriate for their age.</p>
<p>20. Good sleep habits include setting aside devices before bedtime.</p>
<p>21. Students should be mindful if their device use starts to affect their
mood, responsibilities, or relationships, and seek guidance from trusted
adults when this happens.</p>
<h3><strong>Positive Digital Engagement </strong></h3>
<p>22. Students are encouraged to engage in digital activities that contribute
to their growth and learning, such as:</p>
<p>• reading eBooks and educational content</p>
<p>• using educational apps, games, and videos</p>
<p>• creating positive digital content that showcases their learning and
creativity</p>
<p>• collaborating respectfully with classmates on digital projects</p>
<p>23. Devices should be used as tools to support learning and growth, rather
than allowing them to take control of time or emotions.</p>
<h3><strong>Compliance </strong></h3>
<p>24. Comments or postings that teachers find unsuitable should be removed
promptly.</p>
<p>25. Serious violations such as cyberbullying, harassment, or accessing/sharing
inappropriate content may lead to disciplinary action in accordance with
the school's discipline policy.</p>
<p>26. Students are encouraged to seek help from trusted adults when they
encounter online situations that make them uncomfortable or if they're
struggling with their device use.</p>
<h3><strong>For Parents and Guardians</strong></h3>
<p>We encourage you to discuss these guidelines with your child and support
them in developing responsible digital citizenship habits. Please feel
free to contact the school if you have any questions about this policy
or your child's digital learning experience.</p>
