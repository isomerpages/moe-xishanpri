<h3>Cyber Wellness Week 2024</h3>
<p><strong>Wrapping Up Cyber Wellness Week!</strong>
</p>
<p>This week, we explored the theme <strong>"Pause, Think, Protect: Be Cyber Smart!"</strong>
</p>
<p>Our students had an insightful session with professionals from <strong>TOUCH Community</strong>,
where they learned about the <strong>S.U.R.E. framework</strong> during morning
assembly. A key takeaway? <strong>Not everything online is real</strong>â€”so
let's stay sharp, resilient, and safe from cyber threats.</p>
<p>During recess activities, students put their detective skills to the test
by analyzing whether news was real or fake based on given sources. Think
you can spot fake news?</p>
<p>To explore further, students can log into <strong>SLS</strong> to complete
the <strong>S.U.R.E. package</strong> and continue their cyber wellness journey.</p>
