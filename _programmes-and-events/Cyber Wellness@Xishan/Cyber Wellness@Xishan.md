### Cyber Wellness Week 2022

This year’s Cyber Wellness theme is “Be Safe, Be Smart and Be Kind Online”. Our team has prepared a series of enriching activities for our students. Students learnt about managing their online well-being and the positives and negatives of the internet this morning.

During FTGP , we are very honoured to have speakers from Cyberlite to share with our P3-P6 students on Go Safe Online. Each student was also given the Ready, Get Set, Connect! book for them to learn more about cyber safety. We hope that through this, our students will be even more equipped with the necessary skills to protect themselves when they are surfing the internet. 


On the final day of Cyber Wellness Week 2022, we had Kingmaker, a training consultancy, to share with our students on various important aspects of cyber wellness. Our lower primary students revisited the issues of Netiquette and Responsible Behaviour Online while our upper primary students learnt more on Screen Time and Media Multitasking and Devices. We hope that the Cyber Wellness Week has been enriching for our students. Take a look at our students in action!
