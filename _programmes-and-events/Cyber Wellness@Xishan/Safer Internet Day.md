<h1><strong>Safer Internet Day</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Safer Internet Day</strong> is an annual global initiative that
promotes the safe, responsible, and positive use of online technology and
mobile devices among children and young people.</p>
<h3>Theme for Safer Internet Day 2026</h3>
<p><strong>Practise Healthy Digital Habits Together</strong>
</p>
<p>The national theme highlights the importance of building healthy digital
habits as a community. Students will be guided to practise the following <strong>four healthy digital habits</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Set boundaries</strong> to manage screen use and online interactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Think before you act</strong> to safeguard their digital footprint</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Report inappropriate content</strong> to keep themselves and others
safe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Engage a trusted person</strong> and seek support proactively</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These habits help students develop self-control, responsibility, and care
for others in the digital space.</p>

<h3>Partnering Parents</h3>
<p>Parents play an important role in guiding children’s digital habits. Families
are encouraged to have open conversations at home about screen use, online
behaviour, and seeking help when something online feels uncomfortable.
Working together, we can support our students in becoming safe, responsible,
and confident digital users.</p>
