### Learning Difficulty Helps Graduand Better Understand, Connect With Students

We would like to congratulate our teacher, Ms Kleinman who was recently featured on Channel News Asia and in Lianhe Zao Bao for her creative teaching tools used in her English and Social Studies lessons.

She is a role model of resilience. Through overcoming a learning difficulty as a child, she understands that each child is unique and learns in various ways. From her personal experience, she tries to engage her students using innovative and fun educational strategies, such as incorporating puppetry and songs, into her lessons. Her educational philosophy is to live out and impart her educational mission, “Always learning in heart and mind.” She is an inspiration to our students.
