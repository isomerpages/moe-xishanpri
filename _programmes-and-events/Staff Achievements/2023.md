### Inspiring Teacher of English Award

Congratulations to our incredible teacher, Ms Leena, on receiving the Inspiring Teacher of English Award! Indeed, she is the only Primary School teacher who has been awarded this year.

Ms Leena has always exemplified what it means to be an inspiring educator. Her passion for the English language and dedication to her students have left an indelible mark on all of us.

In her own words, Ms Leena shared her thoughts on this achievement: "I am truly humbled by this award. Teaching English isn't just about words; it's about sparking curiosity, fostering creativity, and encouraging self-expression. I've always believed that every student has a unique voice, and my greatest joy has been helping them find it. Thank you to my students for inspiring me every day, and thank you to my colleagues for their support. Together, we make the world a more eloquent place!"

Let's celebrate this well-deserved recognition of an exceptional teacher who has touched our lives and made us fall in love with the beauty of words.
