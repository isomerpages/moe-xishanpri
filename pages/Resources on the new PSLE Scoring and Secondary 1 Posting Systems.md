# **Resources on the new PSLE Scoring and Secondary 1 Posting Systems**

Dear Parents / Guardians,

We thank you for attending our Parents Engagement Session. In the session, we have shared with you the new PSLE Scoring and Secondary 1 Posting Systems.

The new PSLE scoring and Secondary 1 Posting systems will take effect this year. To help you better understand the changes, MOE would like to share the following resources with you:

*   An infosheet which provides an overview of the key changes,
*   Two videos which address commonly asked questions on the new PSLE Scoring and Secondary 1 Posting Systems, and
*   The MOE PSLE microsite that contains information on the changes to the PSLE Scoring and Secondary 1 Posting Systems.
