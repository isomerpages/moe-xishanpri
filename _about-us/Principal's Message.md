Dear Xishanites,

Welcome back to School! As we begin another fantastic academic year, let's take a moment to reflect on our journey in 2023 and look forward to the positive changes we will create in 2024!

In 2022, we witnessed the true grit of our community as we came together to overcome the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic with unwavering resilience and adaptability. We are incredibly grateful that, with the final easing of the safe management measures, we were able to bring back a wide range of activities and programmes that we cherish. Through it all, we grew in confidence and deepened our connections, reinforcing our identity as a compassionate and supportive community.

Last year, we introduced the Game Changer programme, which was truly special. It inspired us to make a difference for our environment, and we took meaningful steps to protect our planet. We became agents of change!

In 2024, we're committed to build on the Game Changer programme and make an even bigger impact. We will expand our environmental initiatives and empower you to be proactive in creating a positive change. Through projects, workshops, and fun activities, we'll deepen your understanding of environmental issues and equip you with the skills to address them. Together, we'll become good stewards of our environment.

Alongside the Game Changer programme, we'll continue to focus on nurturing your confidence and fostering strong connections. We want to inspire your love for learning and helping others, as well as prepare you to be responsible citizens.

Through our collective efforts, we'll create a school community where each of you can thrive and make a positive impact. The Game Changer programme, combined with our emphasis on confidence and connections, will empower you to become leaders and make a difference.

Remember, your actions can shape a brighter and greener future. By choosing sustainable choices, standing up for what's right, and engaging in community projects, you'll make a significant difference in the world.

As we embark on this exciting journey, let's believe in our ability to create change and inspire others to join us. Together, we'll lead the way towards a more sustainable and inclusive future.

Wishing you a year filled with growth, discovery, and positive changes!

Let's make it happen!

Mrs Anne Quek
