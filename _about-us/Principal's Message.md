<h1><strong>Principal's Message 2025</strong></h1>
<p><strong><u>Growing from Legacy, Creating New Possibilities Together</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Welcome back to school! On behalf of the Xishan community, I thank Mrs
Anne Quek for her outstanding leadership and commitment to our school's
growth. Together with our past Principals, Mrs Quek has nurtured Xishan
Primary into a vibrant community while staying true to our school motto
of <em>Love, Care, Share</em>.</p>
<p>This year is particularly special, as we celebrate <strong>88 remarkable years of education</strong> at
Xishan. Our rich legacy is a testament to the hard work, perseverance,
and vision of those who have come before us. It is with great pride that
I also share our school’s achievement of being awarded the Lee Hsien Loong
Award for Innovations in Uplifting Students in 2024, a reflection of how
far we’ve come in nurturing and empowering every Xishanite through a strong
culture of care and inclusivity.</p>
<p>As we look forward, I am excited to introduce our school theme for 2025: <strong>Growing from Legacy, Creating New Possibilities Together</strong>.
This theme not only highlights the growth we have experienced over the
years but also points us toward the exciting opportunities that lie ahead.
Together, as one community, we will continue to build on our strengths
and explore new ways to learn and grow.</p>
<p>At Xishan Primary, our commitment to holistic well-being remains central.
Through our <strong>Keep C.A.L.M. and Give</strong> approach, we will continue
to nurture our students to become <strong>lifelong learners and contributing citizens </strong>who
are both anchored in character values and developed in 21<sup>st</sup> Century
Competencies (E21CC).</p>
<p>As we embark on this new chapter, I invite our entire Xishan community
- staff, students, parents, and partners - to join me and my Vice-Principals,
Ms Latha and Mdm Lee, in<strong> reimagining the possibilities of learning together</strong>.
The future of education, enabled by EdTech, is evolving, and with creativity,
collaboration, and a shared vision, the possibilities before us are truly
infinite. We have created a logo, which encapsulates the key ideas of our
school theme for 2025, with the assistance of DALL-E. This is how we want
to leverage technology to create new pathways together, explore new horizons,
and push the boundaries of what we can achieve. Join us on our transformational
journey!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mrs Jane Chng</p>
<p>Principal</p>
