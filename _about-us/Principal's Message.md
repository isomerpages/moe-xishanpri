<p><strong><u>iCare Leaders: Shaping Tomorrow Today</u></strong>
</p>
<p>As we welcome the new academic year, we are delighted to share our school's
focus for 2026, which builds meaningfully upon the foundation established
last year with our 'Start With Me' theme.</p>
<p>This year marks an exciting milestone as we launch our refreshed Learn
for Life Programme centred on student leadership development. Our theme,<strong> 'Shaping Tomorrow Today',</strong> calls
upon every Xishanite to become a Pioneer of tomorrow by developing self-management
skills, relationship-building capabilities and responsible decision-making
habits that enable them to make positive contributions to their families,
classes, school community and nation.</p>
<p>Just as Singapore's pioneers worked tirelessly to build our nation from
humble beginnings, demonstrating courage, resilience and commitment to
the collective good, we encourage our students to embody this pioneering
spirit by taking initiative, embracing challenges and working towards becoming
better versions of themselves for the benefit of all.</p>
<p>At the heart of this initiative is our<strong> iCARE Student Leadership Framework,</strong> which
nurtures Xishanites to become leaders who innovate creatively, <strong>c</strong>onnect
meaningfully with others, <strong>a</strong>dvocate responsibly for positive
change, <strong>r</strong>ole-model excellence, and lead with <strong>e</strong>mpathy.
This approach aligns closely with our school's vision to develop Lifelong
Learners and Contributing Citizens, firmly anchored in our school values
of Self-Discipline, Integrity, Respect and Resilience, and our school motto
of Love, Care, Share.</p>
<p>Building on last year's 'Start With Me' theme, the lowercase 'i' in <strong>i</strong>CARE
emphasises that <strong>leadership begins with the individual. </strong>Each
Xishanite's journey as an iCARE leader starts with personal growth and
self-management, which then ripples outward to positively impact their
peers, school community and beyond.</p>

<p>We believe that leadership is not confined to those holding formal positions.
Rather, it is about the influence and impact each student can make through
their daily choices and actions. Whether it is finding creative solutions
to everyday challenges, reaching out to support a peer, speaking up for
what is right, choosing to do the right thing when no one is watching,
or taking time to understand different perspectives, <strong>every Xishanite can lead, serve and make a difference.</strong>
</p>
<p>Through this refreshed student leadership curriculum, <strong>we aim to empower every student to become a better version of themselves, equipped with the skills and values to contribute meaningfully to building a caring and enabling school community where everyone can thrive.</strong>
</p>
<p>We look forward to partnering with parents and the wider community on
this journey as we collectively shape tomorrow, today.</p>
