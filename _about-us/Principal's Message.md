# **Principal's Message**

Dear Xishanites,

<img src="/images/2020%20Mrs%20Anne%20Quek.jpg" style="width:183px;height:240px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right">

A warm welcome back to School! Especially all our little ones who have just joined us in 2023. We look forward to knowing all of you real soon!

              2022 was a very exciting year, we celebrated our 85th anniversary with the theme **_The Journey of Mindful Transformation_**. Indeed, it has been most transformational as we were coming out of 2 years of managing and overcoming the COVID pandemic. We have learnt quickly and adapted creatively as we turned the crisis into many opportunities for ourselves. Even in the midst of managing the pandemic, we did not lose sight of what was important to us. We made sure that we constantly checked in on one another’s well-being and kept learning going meaningfully and purposefully.

              The celebration of our 85th anniversary also brought us together as we went through a whole year of celebration. We started work in 2021 and the outcome of the various segments of the celebration was both impactful and inspiring. We were honoured to have the blessings of Minister Chan to open our orchids trail garden, the **_Mindful Blooms_**. We even have our very own orchid hybrid, **_Papilionanda Xishan Mindful 85_**. The garden is so well loved by the students that it inspired our students and teachers to produce the song **_I See My Home_** which was creatively made into a music video.

We are also very proud of the production of our stories through our corporate video. The stories, told through the sharing of our teachers and students, speak of our values, beliefs and hope. Our hearts are full as we look ahead with hope and faith. This hope that we share, is now showcased at our **_Heritage Cove_**, an extension of our Heritage Gallery, where the Wall of Hope captures all the voices of our teachers and students. We ended 2022 on a very high note with the year-end musical **_The Xishan Story_** featuring our own in-house production theme song **_Love, Care and Share_**. We are so proud of who we are, and confident of who we are becoming.

**_The Year of Envisioning_** 

**2023 will be a year of envisioning**. We are more ready than ever to chart our direction for the next phase of growth and development. We will deepen our key framework of **Keep** **_CALM_** **and** **_Give_** and expand our works to tap on the immense possibilities and potential to see every one of you _thrive and flourish_.

Let us forge ahead with love, faith and hope. Let us **_love_** deeply and generously, let us keep our faith and **_confidence_** that **_We Can_** in all situations, let us **_inspire_** hope in ourselves and in each other. Let us reach for the sky together!
