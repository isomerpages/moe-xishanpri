# **Principal's Message**

Dear Xishanites,

<img src="/images/2020%20Mrs%20Anne%20Quek.jpg" style="width:183px;height:240px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right">

This year is a very significant year. This year we celebrate our school’s 85th anniversary! The theme is

**_The Journey of Mindful Transformation_**

Indeed, it has been 85 amazing years of transformational journey. We started off as a small Chinese medium school in Chong Pang Village (originally known as Westhill Village) in 1937. This was why the school adopted Si San (西山) as her name, which is a direct translation of “West Hill”. In 1986, the school took on the Hanyu Pinyin appellation: Xishan, and was officially renamed Xishan Primary School. Over the years, the school journeyed through major historical events, like the Japanese Occupation, Singapore Independence in 1965, and several Education Reforms, what remains unchanged is the core mission of ensuring quality education is accessible to all.

As we prepare ourselves in full anticipations of the exciting programmes lined up to celebrate 85 years of transformation, let’s take a stroll down the more recent memory lane and reflect on how the school has continued the transformation journey in the last 4 years.

_**Mindfulness**_ was introduced in 2018 as a handle to help us learn to be more aware of ourselves and our surroundings. We learnt how to pause and connect with our own thoughts and emotions, how not to judge, both ourselves and others, even when we are not in agreement with how we or others are feeling or behaving at the moment. We learnt how to be mindful and intentional in our thoughts and actions, making conscious efforts to focus on the positive and always making a choice to be grateful in all circumstances. Through it all, we learnt how to embrace ourselves and others better with greater empathy, and what **_“it’s ok not to be ok”_** means.

Using mindfulness as a useful handle to take charge of our thoughts and emotions, we also began to look at learning more intentionally. We introduced **_learning to learn_** programme in 2019 for P3 to P6 to make explicit the learning process with 6 learning principles. We wanted all our students to acquire skills of achievement more effectively, in other words, learn how to learn intentionally and adaptably. We emphasized the importance of developing **_confidence and joy for learning_** and we highlighted the necessity of **_positive struggle for deep learning_**. We are committed in developing all of you to become confident learners who will become effective **_life-long learners_**.

Thereafter, we launched the framework of 5 ways of well-being to encapsulate our approach to equip you with skills of well-being as you work towards becoming a confident learner. Keep **CALM** and **Give** was launched to help all of us understand the five key focus in addressing well-being. Making meaningful and trusting _Connections_ with others, staying _Active_ in physical sports and being active agents of change, taking Learning as a meaningful journey and being _Mindful_ at all times and most importantly, practicing gratitude through _Giving_. The teachers worked hard to ensure all our practices and programmes were aligned to the Keep Calm and Give framework. We are grateful how the framework speaks of our core beliefs and vision for you and we are inspired as we are drawn to the immense possibility and potential to see every one of you _thrive and flourish_.

The physical environment of the school was also undergoing transformation. Many beautiful corners, spaces, rooms, wall visuals were enhanced in phases to support you to learn in a conducive and safe environment. Our hearts are encouraged to see our vision of the beautiful environment taking shape and we want you to know that it gives our immense satisfaction and joy to give you the best. From the _butterfly wall, to the sanctuary, learning cove, imaginarium, eco-garden, edible garden, mindfulness room, e-trail, tinkering space, aqua-ponics,_ and many more to come, every possible space was maximized with you in mind.

And just as we were raring to go further in 2020, COVID-19 came and hit us in unprecedented ways. We had to change and change quickly. Mindfulness practices anchored us as we adapted and innovated through the crisis. Indeed we became more adept in using technology to learn and we also grew in terms of resilience and forged a greater sense of camaraderie as we soldiered through the challenges together. We found ourselves emerging from the 2020 stronger and closer as a school.

However, as we were coming out of 2020, thinking we were more confident and prepared and 2021 would see us resume some more normalcy, we were once again hit with waves of infections. Delta Variant came and huge clusters were reported again. While the experiences learnt in 2020 have definitely put us all in better positions to manage and navigate the new crisis in 2021, it was nevertheless, still a difficult year for many.

Looking back and reflecting on how we rode through these waves of challenges and setbacks, it was having an attitude of gratitude and the intentional effort to focus on the things that give us hope and inspiration that kept us going. So my dear boys and girls, I want to encourage you to continue to do just that. To be like the butterfly in the story on the butterfly wall. It tells of a story of hope, strength and resilience.

The butterfly did not become beautiful and magnificent looking in just a day. It has to go through quite a long process, and not an easy one really. At the last stage before it is transformed into this, it actually has to really struggle to get out of the cocoon. And we now know that the struggling is necessary, for without this struggling, the butterfly would not have gained the strength to spread out its wings and fly.

And the best way to go through seasons of positive struggle is to do it with deep sense of gratitude. Indeed, I am so thankful for the journey thus far, I am thankful for the teachers for giving their best to guide, nurture and care for you, I am thankful for you, all my superheroes for being so brave and resilient and doing your best to learn, I am thankful for all the parents, partnering and supporting the school to give you the best care. Therefore, I want to invite you also, to reflect and be thankful and remain grateful in all circumstances.

So we will set gear to forge ahead with hope, strength and courage. As we celebrate this special year of celebrating 85 years of mindful transformation, let’s begin with a heart of gratitude. We are confident that we are taking a leap into new possibilities and opportunities. We will see many more positive outcomes. My dear boys and girls, my super heroes, let’s remain anchored in kindness and empathy even as we set sail for greater success. For what is most important is to continue to encourage one another with support and empathy as we live out our school motto: Love, Care and Share.

  

Let’s celebrate one another, celebrate our resilience, kindness, empathy, creativity, adaptability and our resolve to keep ourselves on course the mindful transformation journey.

Happy 85th Anniversary!
