Underpinned by our **4 core values (Self-Discipline, Integrity, Respect and Resilience)**, the school endeavours to develop every Xishanite to become flourishing and thriving individuals, learners and citizens, fulfilling the **School Vision: Every Xishanite, a Lifelong Learner, a Contributing Citizen**.

| Values 	| Definition in Xishan’s Context 	|
|---	|---	|
| Self-Discipline 	| take responsibility for one’s own actions and emotions 	|
| Integrity 	| believe in being honest and is upright in deed and word 	|
| Respect 	| value others and is mindful of his/her words and actions to others 	|
| Resilience 	| display growth mindset and perseverance in the face of challenges 	|

A whole school approach is adopted to reinforce the school values of **Self-Discipline, Integrity, Resilience and Respect** (SIRR). Learning of the school values are reinforced within the curriculum in Form Teacher Guidance Programme (FTGP), CCE lessons, Values Education lessons and Assembly programmes as well as CCA.

The school also promotes school values through student leaders. By creating opportunities for students to take up leadership positions, student role model school values in the tasks they perform. Leadership roles such as prefects, monitors, CCA leaders, student leaders, peer support leaders and other task based leadership give students an opportunity to exhibit and promote school values.
