<p>Our Choir is a distinctive combined-school Performing Arts CCA that brings
together students from Xishan Primary School and Northland Primary School.
This meaningful partnership provides students with the opportunity to learn,
rehearse, and perform alongside peers from another school, fostering camaraderie
and a shared sense of purpose.</p>
<p>Together, the choir has proudly represented both schools at the Singapore
Youth Festival (SYF) 2024. They have also performed annually at Xishan
Primary School’s CCA Bazaar and Open House since 2024, and most recently
showcased their talents in Northland Primary School’s 2025 musical production,
Applause, held at Republic Polytechnic</p>
<h3><strong>Our Focus: V.O.I.C.E.</strong></h3>
<p>Through structured vocal training, sectional practices, and full choir
rehearsals, members develop strong foundational singing techniques, musical
expression, and stage confidence. Our programme is guided by the V.O.I.C.E.
framework:</p>
<h4><strong>V – Vocal Excellence</strong></h4>
<p>Developing strong vocal techniques, musical accuracy, and expressive singing.</p>
<h4><strong>O – Ownership &amp; Discipline</strong></h4>
<p>Demonstrating commitment, responsibility, and consistent effort in rehearsals
and performances.</p>
<h4><strong>I – Inclusion &amp; Teamwork</strong></h4>
<p>Blending voices harmoniously and fostering unity across two schools as
one choir.</p>
<h4><strong>C – Confidence &amp; Character</strong></h4>
<p>Building self-assurance, resilience, respect, and positive stage presence.</p>
<h4><strong>E – Empowered Leadership</strong></h4>
<p>Providing opportunities for student and sectional leaders to guide, mentor,
and inspire others.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Learning Experiences</strong></h4>

Choir</p>
<p>• Choir Exchange Programme with two schools at North Vista Primary School
