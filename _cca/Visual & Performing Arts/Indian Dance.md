### Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2022Â 

Our Indian Dancers took part in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2022 at Gateway Theatre. Our Primary 3 to 6 dancers exhibited confidence and resilience as they worked together as a team to put up their best performance.  

A heartfelt gratitude to all parents, teachers and the Indian Dance instructor for supporting our girls to showcase their talents.
