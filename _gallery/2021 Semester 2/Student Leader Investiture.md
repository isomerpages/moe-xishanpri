# **Student Leader Investiture**

The Student Leader Investiture is a ceremony to formally officiate the appointments of our prefects and CCA leaders. The investiture was held virtually in school on 26 July. On this special day, we celebrated the appointment of 51 new prefects, 35 CCA leaders and 5 executive members.

This video features the highlights of the student leadership experience in Xishan Primary School. This year, we are happy to have our student leader alumni to share their wishes and the valuable lessons they gained from their leadership journey.

It takes a village to raise a child. We would like to take this opportunity to thank all parents, teachers and school leaders for your support in Xishanitesâ€™ leadership journey.
