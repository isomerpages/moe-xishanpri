# **Children's Day**

This year, Children's Day is going to take a very different form for all of us. Our form teachers had synchronous Zoom sessions with their students this morning. Though teachers were not able to meet face to face with their classes, everyone was still able to have fun by being creative on Zoom. We spotted some very interesting games being played! It may be a difficult time but we want to remind everyone that this will pass. We will emerge stronger and more resilient.

Happy Children's Day for all our wonderful Xishanites!

On this Children's day, we want to remind every Xishanite that you are wonderfully unique and special in your own way.
