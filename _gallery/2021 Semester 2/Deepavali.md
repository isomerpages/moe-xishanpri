# **Deepavali**

This yearâ€™s Deepavali celebration at Xishan has been an enriching experience for our students. As they watched a video about the origin of Deepavali, they also learnt about the significance of celebrating this festival. Our students were also engaged in artworks such as filling in colours on the printed Rangoli patterns.
