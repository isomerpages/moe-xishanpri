# **National Day**

National Day is a commemoration of our independence, an opportunity to reflect and celebrate how far we have come as a nation, and a timely reminder of our resilient Singapore spirit.

Watch how Xishanites celebrate this important day through our Observance Ceremony. In times good and bad, as long as we rally together, Singaporeans can overcome any challenges that come our way.

We enjoyed listening together to the uplifting National Day theme song, ‘The Road Ahead’, every morning! The song reminds us that there is strength in unity. It also encourages us that as long as we stand together, we can overcome the challenges ahead just like our National Day theme this year - ‘Together, Our Singapore Spirit’!

Our school leaders and teachers would like to dedicate this song to all of you.

Celebrating Singapore’s 56th Birthday amidst the challenging times, the happy and proud smiles of our Xishanites still shine through. Xishanites also expressed their gratitude and appreciation to our frontline medical heroes. Singapore may be a little red dot, but with everyone supporting and appreciating one another, our roar can certainly be heard far and wide.
