# **National Day**

National Day is a commemoration of our independence, an opportunity to reflect and celebrate how far we have come as a nation, and a timely reminder of our resilient Singapore spirit.

Watch how Xishanites celebrate this important day through our Observance Ceremony. In times good and bad, as long as we rally together, Singaporeans can overcome any challenges that come our way.
