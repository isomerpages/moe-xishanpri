### Celebrating Achievements, Leaps and Milestones

Celebrating Achievements, Leaps and Milestones’ resonates among Xishanities as we celebrate the many outstanding achievements of our students. Our Prize Giving Ceremony this year is held on Friday, 19 November for the P5 and P6 academic and AREA prize winners. This also includes the Xishan Character Award which was given out on Wednesday, 17 November. Furthermore, our ECHA/EAGLES winners will be featured in a photo montage.
