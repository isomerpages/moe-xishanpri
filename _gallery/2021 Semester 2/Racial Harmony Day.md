# **Racial Harmony Day**

Today, we commemorated Racial Harmony Day. The students had enriching conversations in the classroom at the start of the week during Assembly Period. The teachers had meaningful sharing during their Staff Contact. Xishanites will stand united as one, continue to respect one another and learn to appreciate one another's cultures and practices.
