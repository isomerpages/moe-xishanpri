<p><strong>P1 Registration Information</strong>
</p>
<p>In view of the COVID-19 situation, there will&nbsp;<strong>not be any in-person registration</strong>&nbsp;at
schools for the upcoming P1 2020 exercise. Parents/Guardians will be required
to register their children online.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For children who are Singapore Citizens or Singapore Permanent Residents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Born between 2 January 2014 and 1 January 2015 (both dates inclusive).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Singapore Citizens (SCs) will be given absolute priority over Singapore
Permanent Residents (PRs) when balloting is necessary in a specific phase.
SCs and PRs will continue to be eligible for the same phases, and all applicants
will be admitted if the total number of applications in any phase does
not exceed the number of vacancies. However, if the number of applications
exceeds the number of vacancies in a specific phase, SCs will be admitted
first ahead of PRs, before home-school distance is considered.</p>
