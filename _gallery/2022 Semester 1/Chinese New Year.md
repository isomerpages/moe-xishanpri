# **Chinese New Year**

What does Chinese New Year mean to you?

To Xishanites, this is a good time to express our gratitude to the people around us. We took this chance to give thanks to our unsung heroes in school. Our students also learnt more about different types of food we eat during Chinese New Year and went around the world virtually to find out about how this festive season is celebrated differently.

We wish everyone a prosperous year ahead!
