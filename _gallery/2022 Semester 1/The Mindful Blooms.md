# **The Mindful Blooms**

We are honoured to have Minister Chan's presence for the opening of The Mindful Blooms, which displays 85 types of orchids to represent every year of Xishan history, as well as the unveiling of our very own 85th orchid hybrid named as 'Papilionanda Xishan Mindful 85'. Our student ambassadors had the opportunity to lead Minister Chan on a school tour and introduce to him the different learning spaces around the school. We are proud of their confidence when they interacted with Minister.
