# **International Friendship Day**

![](/images/IFD4.jpg)

We commemorated International Friendship Day. Over the Form Teachers Period, we shared with our Xishanites about what IFD is and why it is important to be connected with our neighbouring countries, especially the ASEAN countries. This  year’s IFD theme is Singapore in Asia. We look deeper in how Singapore plays an important role in Asia through the FTGP and CCE packages.   

We continue to celebrate the region’s diversity and vibrancy and promote the spirit of friendship and collaboration. More information on ASEAN countries are placed near the canteen area. Each student is given a quiz handout and is encouraged to go to the area to learn more about our neighbouring friends. It is heartening to see many Xishanites are simply curious to find out more about the ASEAN countries.


In the spirit of our 85th anniversary celebrations, national flowers of each country are also shared to our Xishanites. Xishanites are encouraged to fold an origami flower to experience how a simple square paper can be transformed into a beautiful flower. Students get to gift their friends the origami flower with a personalised written friendly message to them. This serves as a gesture of appreciation to their friends.

We conclude the CCE-IFD lessons for all Xishanites. We hope our Xishanites continue to learn more about ASEAN countries and most importantly, to continue to forge close friendships with fellow Xishanites. The kind notes that they have written for one another and the flower origami they have learnt to fold serve as a reminder that we will always continue to love, care and share with one another.

Special thanks to our PSG members who have enthusiastically come forward to be part of the IFD commemoration this year. We are so glad you are back to interact with our Xishanites again! Thanks for helping us to put the folded flowers into beautiful bouquets!
