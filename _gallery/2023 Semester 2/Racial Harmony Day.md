Every year, Singapore commemorates Racial Harmony Day on 21st July. It is a day to remind ourselves about the importance of racial harmony. The theme, Our Multicultural Mosaic, reflects the rich diversity that is unique to this island we all call home. During the myriad of activities comprising of the assembly presentation, instrumental and ethnic dance performance, CCE (FTGP) lessons, reflection journal, and recess activities, the students discussed and looked at the ways how they can contribute to Our Multicultural Mosaic, such as respecting our differences and celebrating our similarities.
