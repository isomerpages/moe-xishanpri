Throwback to 31 August where our students and teachers came together to celebrate Teachers’ Day 2023! This year's theme, “Appreciating our Teachers. Celebrating As One.”, conveys our hopes and endeavours.

Through the celebrations, our Xishanites reflected on the meaning of Teachers’ Day as well as the hard and “heart” work they have put in to grow each and every student in Xishan. Our teachers and students also spent the morning immersing themselves in the various activities to show their appreciation and gratitude to their teachers on this special day. We hoped our Xishan staff a wonderful and meaningful Teachers’ Day 2023!
