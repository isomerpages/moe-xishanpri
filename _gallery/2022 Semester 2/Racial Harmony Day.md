# **Racial Harmony Day**

### Our Multicultural Mosaic

This year, the theme for Racial Harmony Day (RHD) is Our Multicultural Mosaic. It reflects how each community, while having the space to express its own identity as part of Singapore society, also intertwines with others to depict the unique cultural diversity that characterises Singapore life.

RHD commemoration in Xishan started on Monday 18 July. Students enjoyed an assembly programme and played traditional games during recess with friends of different races. They learnt how to show respect for others and the importance of maintaining racial harmony in Singapore.

On Thursday 21 July, our students were encouraged to put on ethnic attire to show their appreciation for the culture of the different ethnic groups in Singapore. During recess, they attempted a variety of cultural activities with friends of different races. Active participants redeemed traditional games which they could use to continue the respectful interaction with their peers.

For these few weeks, they also get to better understand how they can actively contribute to the racial harmony in Singapore through lessons related to RHD during CCE lessons, Social Studies lessons and Form Teacher Time.
