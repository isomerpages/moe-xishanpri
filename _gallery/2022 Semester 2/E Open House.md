# **E- Open House**

We will be pivoting to an E-Open House on 19 July, 5 â€“ 6pm! In view of the potential wave of COVID-19, we are taking precautionary measures to ensure the safety and well-being of our students, staff and guests while you get to experience the Xishan family culture virtually.

For those who have indicated your interest earlier, we will be reaching out to you via email to inform you of the change. Those who wish to sign up may scan the QR code to indicate your interest! Limited slots only!
