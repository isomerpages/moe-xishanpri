# **Total Defence Day**

Xishan Primary commemorates Total Defence Day! The students of Xishan Primary School rallied together to perform the Wipe-Down routine during their recess. This routine is simply getting students to clean the table surface after their meals in the school canteen. Through this initiative, our Principal Mrs Quek hopes to develop in every student a strong sense of civic-mindedness and social responsibility to build a gracious and hygienic environment for all.

The students learnt about how they too can play a part in Total Defence by pledging to maintain positive hygiene practices in school and at home. They also learnt about the sacrifices made by front-liners in the different ministries in Singaporeâ€™s current fight against COVID-19. In response, the students designed cards with personal thoughts to show their appreciation for these unsung heroes.

Together we keep Singapore strong!
