# **2021 Chinese New Year**

To celebrate Chinese New Year, Xishanites wore red or Chinese ethnic attire. This year’s theme is ‘Happy Ox-spicious New Year’. Our students were engaged in a series of meaningful and joyful activities. Especially for the classroom décor, they created Ox-spicious artwork. In the celebrative mood of sharing and caring, our school paid tribute to our Unsung Heroes, the non-teaching staff who have played a vital role in ensuring that our school is a safe environment for all. We have partnered with Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) in Project Hongbao 2021. Pupils can make a small donation to the Community Fund from the red packets they will be receiving, playing their part in giving back to society. We are pleased to share that our SAC member, Mrs Agnes Sim, was awarded the Service to Education Silver Award. Finally, we would like to wish everyone a Happy Ox-spicious New Year!
