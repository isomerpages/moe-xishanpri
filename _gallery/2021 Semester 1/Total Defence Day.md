# **Total Defence Day**

We commemorate Total Defence Day to remind us of what Singapore would be like if we are unable to defend ourselves. The Spirit of Total Defence has seen us through difficult times such as the SARS outbreak in 2003 and threat of terrorism. It continues to lead us in our fight against the current Covid-19 pandemic. Every Singaporean plays a vital role in making Singapore a strong, secure and cohesive nation. Only when we are strong, then will we be able to deal with any crisis.

Our students in Xishan are never too young to play a part in our nation’s Total Defence. Today, their minds are intrigued by the 6 pillars of Total Defence. Their understanding will deepen as they participate in meaningful activities during Form Teacher’s Time, CCE periods and Social Studies lessons in the coming two weeks.
