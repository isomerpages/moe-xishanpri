# **P5 & P6 Parents Engagement Sessions**

We had our first Parents Engagement Session on 22 January 2021. The objective of these sessions is to strengthen home-school partnership. We shared our key directions, programmes and assessment matters. We thanked all the parents and guardians of P5 and P6 students for taking the time to interact with our teachers.
