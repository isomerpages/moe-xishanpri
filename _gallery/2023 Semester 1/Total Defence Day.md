'Together we keep Singapore Strong' – the motto for this year’s Total Defence Day (TDD) reminds us constantly not to take Singapore’s security, peace and stability for granted.

Here in Xishan, we commemorated TDD through our own TDD programme which comprises of CCE(FTGP) lessons, classroom activities from Kindsville Times magazines, TDD school assembly, Gratitude Journal entries and recess activities. Our students participated actively in all the activities and had a splendid fun-loving time, especially during the recess activities where they learnt to tie an arm sling bandage, pack necessities into a Grab-n-Go bag, and find the six pillars of TDD in an enormous TDD poster.
