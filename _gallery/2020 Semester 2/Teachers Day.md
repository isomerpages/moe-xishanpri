# **Teachers' Day**

Xishanites celebrate Teachers’ Day with gusto today. The challenging situation right now did not hinder the students’ enthusiasm in showing gratitude and appreciation to their teachers. All the activities were brought into the classroom. First, our Principal addressed the school with a special message. This was followed by a string of entertaining activities showcasing the varied talents of Xishanites; renditions of heartfelt songs, K-pop dance and Guzheng performances, recitation of poems of gratitude and the singing of our very own Teachers’ Day Song which was composed by our teacher. Students had an enjoyable time bonding with their teachers during the interactive games session. The sweet moments will always be captured in our hearts. Thank you, to the Xishan family!
