# **Racial Harmony Day**

![](/images/RDH%20(1).jpeg)

Xishan Primary School commemorated Racial Harmony Day on 17 July. The theme for this yearâ€™s Racial Harmony Day is Multicultural Singapore. Our students donned their ethnic wear and participated in class-based lessons and online activities on SLS. Students penned down their learning on orange ribbons during their CCE lessons.

During the assembly programme, teachers facilitated discussions to emphasise the importance of preserving and sustaining harmony within the community. Harmony embraces differences which helps to strengthen the bonds we share with one another.
