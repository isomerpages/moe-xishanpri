<h1><strong>Science</strong></h1>
<h4><strong>Vision</strong><br></h4>
<p>Passionate scientific inquirers who are curious, confident and innovative
learners​.</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>
<br>To nurture curious and confident individuals who pursue Science with curiosity,
clarity and care, while applying their learning meaningfully to real-world
contexts.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Focus</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>We grow every Xishanite through:</p>
<p>• <strong>Engaging and hand-on lessons</strong> inspired by the 5E Inquiry
Model (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate)</p>
<p>• <strong>Core scientific knowledge,</strong> anchored in five foundational
themes: Diversity, Cycles, Systems, Interactions, and Energy</p>
<p>• <strong>Key values and mindsets</strong> fostered through inquiry: curiosity,
resilience, responsibility, and integrity</p>
<p>Science at Xishan is about <strong>observing carefully, linking ideas meaningfully, and communicating with evidence and sound reasoning.</strong> This
aligns with MOE’s Science Curriculum Framework, which emphasises curiosity,
conceptual understanding, inquiry skills, values, and application.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>Science learning at Xishan is <strong>active, authentic and communicative</strong>:</p>
<p>• <strong>Inquiry over answers</strong>: Practical investigations and real-world
phenomena invite questioning and sense-making.</p>
<p>• <strong>Clear and confident communication:</strong> Xishanites learn to
present ideas using oral presentations, diagrams, models, graphs, and writing
frames grounded in evidence.</p>
<p>• <strong>Structured progression</strong>: Scaffolded support in the lower
primary years builds towards greater independence and self-directed inquiry
in the upper primary years.</p>
<p>In line with MOE’s 3INs (Inspire, Inquire, Innovate), our teachers act
as facilitators who guide students to become lifelong learners.</p>

<p>• <strong>School Gardens &amp; Aquaponics:</strong> Hands-on platforms for
exploring how living things depend on one another and caring for the environment.
Platforms for exploring how living things depend on one another and caring
for the environment. Refurbished in 2024, building on our Xishanites’ Distinction
project at the 2023 Singapore Youth Science Fair. This showcases how Xishanites
can turn ideas into practical, real-world solutions.</p>

<p>• <strong>Learning Journeys &amp; Workshops:</strong> Contextual learning
at authentic settings such as the Singapore Zoo (P3) and Sungei Buloh Wetland
Reserve (P6), reinforcing science concepts and extending learning beyond
the classroom.</p>

<h4><strong>How We Know Learning is Happening</strong></h4>
<p>We use age-appropriate approaches such as talk prompts, exit slips, hands-on
checkpoints, and term reviews to guide us in providing timely feedback
to our students on how they are progressing and ways to improve.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Our Commitment</strong></h4>
<p>By the end of Primary 6, every Xishanite will have the skills to<strong> OBSERVE</strong> closely, <strong>LINK</strong> ideas
thoughtfully and <strong>COMMUNICATE</strong> Science with clarity and confidence.
More importantly, they will have the courage to turn ideas into meaningful
actions that makes a difference in our world.</p>
