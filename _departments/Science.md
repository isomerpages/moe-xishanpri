The Science curriculum encourages students to learn Science through understanding basic concepts and applying what they have learnt in different contexts. The focus of learning Science is on developing students' ability to inquire, understand and explain scientific phenomena with clarity.  

### Key Programmes

_**1\. Igniting Curiosity through Science Inquiry**_

In Science teaching and learning, activities are specially planned to integrate skills and processes which arouse students’ curiosity and encourage them to seek new knowledge and inquire about things around them. With the focus on conceptual understanding and skills development, students are encouraged to ask questions to deepen their learning as they quest for new knowledge and embark on their journey of continuous learning.

**_2\. Enriched Learning @ Our School Garden_**

The school garden is a rich learning ground designed to bring out students’ natural curiosity and to encourage them to actively explore, engage with and experience the natural environment. Interesting programmes and engaging activities are designed to enhance students’ capacities for creativity and intellectual development in learning beyond the classroom.

**_3\. Enriched Learning @ Our School Aquaponics System_**

The school outdoor aquaponics system, consisting of 3 vegetables grow beds and 2 tilapia fish culture tanks, arouses students’ curiosity and deepens their conceptual understanding of the different types of sustainable farming systems and their benefits to Singapore. 

Through first-hand observations, students get a deeper understanding of the symbiotic relationship between the tilapia fish and vegetables, in which the tilapia fish’s excreta provide nutrients to the plants, while the plants naturally clean up the water for the fish. Students get to appreciate the role of bacteria as decomposers that break down excreta of tilapia fish to provide nutrients for the plants. 

Students also get to experience the process of growing their own vegetables from sowing and germinating seeds, transplanting seedlings and lastly, harvesting their own produce from the aquaponics system.

**_4\. Learning Journeys & Workshops_** 

Learning Journeys and workshops are specially organized for all Primary 3 to 6 students to complement the Science curriculum and allow students to reinforce their learning through exploration in a natural setting beyond the school. Students as active learners are given the opportunities to discover and experience the natural environment at first hand. Learning is enriched as they make new discoveries in their quest for new knowledge.  

Primary 3: Virtual Learning Journey to Singapore Botanic Gardens   
Primary 4: Science Workshop (Heat & Temperature)   
Primary 5: Science Workshop (Wind Turbine)  
Primary 6: Physical Learning Journey to Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve
