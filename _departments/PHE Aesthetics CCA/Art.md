### Art Curriculum

In Xishan, we aim to develop Xishanites to be confident in expressing himself visually and verbally. Experiences within and beyond the classroom are intentionally created.   

### Experiences within the classroom

Art discussion is an essential part of art lesson. It enriches and deepens students’ learning of art. In this video, a group of students acted out a scene in the artwork, ‘Life by the River (Liu Kang, 1975)’.  Two acted as villagers chopping down trees to make houses.

Students are also exposed to a range of media. In the picture below, on the left, students were exploring making forms using papers. On the right are works created with various media.
