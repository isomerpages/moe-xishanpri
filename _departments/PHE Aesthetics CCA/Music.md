# **Music**

In Xishan, we aim to develop Xishanites to be an appreciative audience and a dedicated performer. Experiences for Xishanites to enjoy musicking and to empower them to make musical decisions are created.   

### Our Curriculum Focus

Music education involves listening and responding to music, creating and performing music.   

In learning music, students will be exposed to a range of classroom music instruments and music repertoire. In addition, students will learn and apply musical elements and concepts and appreciate music from local and global cultures.

Xishan's music programmes allow students to express themselves musically. There are opportunities for students to create and perform music during music lessons.  There are also performing platforms beyond music lessons. Through performing, students develop musical communication. Students collaborate and develop interpersonal skills while working in an ensemble.  

Watch the videos below to have a glimpse of students’ music learning experience.
