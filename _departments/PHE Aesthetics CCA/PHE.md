### Objectives
Develop active and resilient students by increasing students’ confidence in leading an active and healthy lifestyle

### Syllabus / Framework
The primary level physical education programme provides a range of movement experiences to develop students’ overall development. The purpose is to help all students develop a foundation for an active life.

The lower primary level focuses on mastery of fundamental motor skills such as locomotor, non-locomotor and manipulative skills with application of movement concepts to develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in students’ performance.

Once the foundation is laid, the upper primary level extends on the mastery of discrete skills to focus on more complex combinations and sequences of movements, and skills application in more recognisable forms of activity and games.

The syllabus provides diversity and breadth for schools to plan and implement a well-balanced physical education programme. There are seven learning areas that facilitate the organisation of learning experiences in the primary schools.

*   Athletics (from Primary 3)
*   Dance
*   Games and Sports
*   Gymnastics
*   Physical Health and Fitness
*   Swimming (by the end of Primary 6)
*   Outdoor Education

### Key Programmes

### Rise to Shine

Rise to Shine encourages all our students to arrive in school early to join their friends in unstructured play. The students will learn to interact independently and creatively with the equipment provided by the Teachers.

The School Field, Parade Square as well as the School Hall are available for our students during Rise to Shine.

### Graduation Run
Graduation Run was inaugurated by our Principal Mrs Quek in 2019.

The run serves as a significant milestone for our graduating students. Through the run, the school hopes to help our students learn that life is neither about how fast you go or whether you have had a good start, nor about comparing with others who are ahead or behind you. It is really about how meaningful and purposeful the journey will be.

The run takes place within the school compound. As the students take a jog down memory lane whilst jogging with their buddies, they are filled with gratitude when they reflect upon their journey of learning in Xishan Primary School.
