<h3>Art Curriculum</h3>
<p>The aims of art education in our schools are to enable every child to</p>
<p>• enjoy art</p>
<p>• communicate visually</p>
<p>• make meaning through connecting with society and culture.</p>
<p>Guided by the aims, learning experiences within and beyond the classroom
are intentionally created to build Xishanites’ confidence in expressing
himself visually and verbally.</p>
<h3>Experiences within the classroom</h3>
<p>In an art classroom, students learn and understand art through art making
and art discussion. Students are also engaged in various artistic processes
and exposed to a range of media.</p>
