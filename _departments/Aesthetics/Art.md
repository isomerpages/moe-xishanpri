<h1><strong>Art</strong></h1>
<h3>Art Curriculum</h3>
<p>The aims of art education in our schools are to enable every child to</p>
<p>• enjoy art</p>
<p>• communicate visually</p>
<p>• make meaning through connecting with society and culture.</p>
<p>Guided by the aims, learning experiences within and beyond the classroom
are intentionally created to build Xishanites’ confidence in expressing
himself visually and verbally.</p>
<h3>Experiences within the classroom</h3>
<p>In an art classroom, students learn and understand art through art making
and art discussion. Students are also engaged in various artistic processes
and exposed to a range of media.</p>

<h3>Experiences beyond the classroom</h3>
<p>Art and Music Week (AMW) is a week of celebration of Art and Music. Various
activities are carried out to celebrate students’ learning in the Art and
Music. For Art, there are assembly talks, activities and exhibition to
engage the students.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, AMW started to go online! Check out one of the online
galleries.</p>
<h3>Museum-based learning (MBL)</h3>
<p>(insert google slides)</p>
<p>Museum-based learning (MBL) is one of the platforms to provide engaging
and meaningful ways for students to encounter learning art content. Going
to the museum also provides an authentic context for the learning of local
art. In addition, the experience will develop in students the competencies
and dispositions of an Audience.</p>
