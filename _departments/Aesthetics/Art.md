<h3>Art Curriculum</h3>
<p>The aims of art education in our schools are to enable every child to</p>
<p>• enjoy art</p>
<p>• communicate visually</p>
<p>• make meaning through connecting with society and culture.</p>
<p>Guided by the aims, learning experiences within and beyond the classroom
are intentionally created to build Xishanites’ confidence in expressing
himself visually and verbally.</p>
<h3>Experiences within the classroom</h3>
<p>In an art classroom, students learn and understand art through art making
and art discussion. Students are also engaged in various artistic processes
and exposed to a range of media.</p>

<h3>Museum-based learning (MBL)</h3>
<p>Museum-based learning (MBL) is one of the platforms to provide engaging
and meaningful ways for students to encounter learning art content. Going
to the museum also provides an authentic context for the learning of local
art. In addition, the experience will develop in students the competencies
and dispositions of an Audience.</p>
