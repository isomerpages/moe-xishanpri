<h1><strong>Music</strong></h1>
<p>At Xishan, we aim to develop Xishanites as both appreciative audiences
and committed performers. We create opportunities for them to enjoy musicking
and empower them to make informed musical decisions.</p>
<h4><u>Our Curriculum Focus</u></h4>
<p>Music education involves listening and responding to music, as well as
creating and performing it.</p>
<p>In the process of learning music, students are exposed to a range of classroom
instruments and musical repertoire. They learn and apply musical elements
and concepts and develop an appreciation of music from both local and global
cultures.</p>
<p>Xishan’s music programmes provide students with opportunities to express
themselves musically through creating and performing music during lessons,
as well as on platforms beyond the classroom. Through these performance
experiences, students develop musical communication skills. Working in
ensembles also allows students to collaborate and build strong interpersonal
skills.</p>

<p><strong>The Youth Station Project</strong> provides students with the opportunity
to write their own music and create it using digital audio workstations
(DAWs) such as GarageBand, or to perform their compositions live. Selected
or interested students work closely with their music teachers throughout
the project to develop their ideas and prepare for participation.</p>
<p>We are honoured to see our participating students nominated, with their
work featured on the Youth <strong>Station YouTube channel,</strong> recognising
their creativity and musical achievements.</p>

<h4><u>Music Concerts</u></h4>
<p><strong>Xishan Got Talent</strong> is an annual programme that provides
students with opportunities to showcase their abilities and affirm their
strengths in their chosen talent areas. Through performance, students build
confidence, celebrate their unique talents, and develop a strong sense
of self-belief.</p>
<p><strong>Music Fiesta</strong> is a performance platform where selected
students showcase their musical learning from the music classroom. Students
demonstrate their skills on instruments such as the cajon, ukulele, recorder,
drums, and xylophones, as well as through singing. These performances are
presented on stage during <strong>Xishan Celebrates,</strong> allowing students
to share their learning with the school community.</p>

<p><strong>Recess Concert</strong> is another platform where students showcase
their musical talents by playing instruments or singing on our very own
library stage during recess. Peers and students from the same recess period
gather to support the performers, often singing along and creating a lively
and encouraging atmosphere.</p>
