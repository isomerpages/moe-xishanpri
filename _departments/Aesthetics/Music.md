<h1><strong>Music</strong></h1>
<p>At Xishan, we aim to develop Xishanites as both appreciative audiences
and committed performers. We create opportunities for them to enjoy musicking
and empower them to make informed musical decisions.</p>
<h4><u>Our Curriculum Focus</u></h4>
<p>Music education involves listening and responding to music, as well as
creating and performing it.</p>
<p>In the process of learning music, students are exposed to a range of classroom
instruments and musical repertoire. They learn and apply musical elements
and concepts and develop an appreciation of music from both local and global
cultures.</p>
<p>Xishan’s music programmes provide students with opportunities to express
themselves musically through creating and performing music during lessons,
as well as on platforms beyond the classroom. Through these performance
experiences, students develop musical communication skills. Working in
ensembles also allows students to collaborate and build strong interpersonal
skills.</p>

<h4><u>Experiences beyond the classroom</u></h4>
<p>Art and Music Week (AMW) is a week-long celebration of students’ learning
in Art and Music. A variety of activities are organised to showcase and
celebrate their work. As part of the music programme, assembly talks, interactive
activities, and performances are conducted to engage students. Watch the
video below to see our music teachers in action during an assembly talk.</p>

<p><strong>The Youth Station Project</strong> provides students with the opportunity
to write their own music and create it using digital audio workstations
(DAWs) such as GarageBand, or to perform their compositions live. Selected
or interested students work closely with their music teachers throughout
the project to develop their ideas and prepare for participation.</p>
<p>We are honoured to see our participating students nominated, with their
work featured on the Youth <strong>Station YouTube channel,</strong> recognising
their creativity and musical achievements.</p>
