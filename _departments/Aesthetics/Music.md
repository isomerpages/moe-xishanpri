<h1><strong>Music</strong></h1>
<p>At Xishan, we aim to develop Xishanites as both appreciative audiences
and committed performers. We create opportunities for them to enjoy musicking
and empower them to make informed musical decisions.</p>
<h4><u>Our Curriculum Focus</u></h4>
<p>Music education involves listening and responding to music, as well as
creating and performing it.</p>
<p>In the process of learning music, students are exposed to a range of classroom
instruments and musical repertoire. They learn and apply musical elements
and concepts and develop an appreciation of music from both local and global
cultures.</p>
<p>Xishan’s music programmes provide students with opportunities to express
themselves musically through creating and performing music during lessons,
as well as on platforms beyond the classroom. Through these performance
experiences, students develop musical communication skills. Working in
ensembles also allows students to collaborate and build strong interpersonal
skills.</p>
