# **Mathematics**

**Vision:** Every pupil an&nbsp;**effective**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**confident**&nbsp;problem-solver

**Mission:** To cultivate&nbsp;**an inquiring mind**&nbsp;and to develop&nbsp;**mathematical reasoning**&nbsp;in problem solving

The Mathematics Curriculum in Xishan Primary School is centred on  Problem Solving, with the five key supporting components as illustrated in the in the MOE Mathematics Curriculum Framework. We focus on building strong fundamentals as the foundation for cultivating an inquiring mind and developing mathematical reasoning in problem solving.   

In Xishan Primary School, pupils are given opportunities to discuss, reason, and reflect, through various learning experiences and technological explorations to: 

•	Develop a deep understanding of mathematical concepts
•	Make meaningful connections between mathematical ideas
•	Appreciate the applications and relevance of Mathematics in everyday life



### Teaching Approaches

•	Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) Approach

Teachers curate meaningful learning experiences for pupils to first use concrete objects to explore and understand mathematical concepts and ideas. Pupils then progress to pictorial representations, such as diagrams and models, which help them visualize and make sense of the concepts. Finally, pupils are introduced to symbols and equations, enabling them to represent the concepts in their abstract form.

**•	Mathematical Problem-Solving Approach**

At Xishan Primary School, we use the BEST Problem-Solving Approach to help pupils develop confidence and competence in solving mathematical problems. Through this approach, teachers guide pupils to apply systematic thinking routines and a range of heuristic strategies, enabling them to analyse problems, explore possible solutions and solve mathematics problems.

**•	Inquiry- based Learning **

Through Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL), pupils are presented with problem situations and encouraged to explore ideas and patterns to find solutions. Teachers carefully sequence and facilitate class discussions, guiding pupils as they co-construct their understanding of mathematical concepts. This approach nurtures critical, adaptive, and inventive thinking, while helping pupils appreciate the relevance of Mathematics in real-life contexts.

**•	Outdoor and Home-based Learning Experiences.**

We also extend learning beyond the classroom doors for pupils to apply mathematical concepts in real world context. These meaningful activities nurture an appreciation of how Mathematics is all around us.

### Technological explorations

Teachers design Student Learning Space (SLS) lessons and integrate interactive digital manipulatives to help pupils visualise abstract mathematical concepts and receive instant feedback on their learning. Technology also allows pupils to collaborate seamlessly and learn at their own pace, deepening their understanding and making Mathematics lessons more engaging and meaningful.
