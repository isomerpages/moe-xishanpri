<h1><strong>Mathematics</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>: Every pupil an&nbsp;effective&nbsp;and&nbsp;confident&nbsp;problem-solver</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>: To cultivate&nbsp;an inquiring mind&nbsp;and
to develop&nbsp;mathematical reasoning&nbsp;in problem solving</p>
<p>The Mathematics Curriculum in Xishan Primary School is&nbsp;centred on
Problem Solving,&nbsp;with the five key supporting components as illustrated
in the MOE Mathematics Curriculum Framework. We focus on building strong
fundamentals&nbsp;as the foundation for cultivating an inquiring mind and
developing mathematical reasoning in problem solving.</p>

<p>In Xishan Primary School, pupils are given opportunities to <strong>discuss, reason, and reflect</strong>,
through various learning experiences and technological explorations to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Develop a deep understanding of mathematical concepts</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Make meaningful connections between mathematical ideas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appreciate the applications and relevance of Mathematics in everyday life</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Teaching Approaches</h2>
<h3>Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) Approach</h3>
<p>Teachers curate meaningful learning experiences for pupils to first use
concrete objects to explore and understand mathematical concepts and ideas.
Pupils then progress to pictorial representations, such as diagrams and
models, which help them visualize and make sense of the concepts. Finally,
pupils are introduced to symbols and equations, enabling them to represent
the concepts in their abstract form.</p>

<h3>Mathematical Problem-Solving Approach</h3>
<p>At Xishan Primary School, we use the BEST Problem-Solving Approach to
help pupils develop confidence and competence in solving mathematical problems.
Through this approach, teachers guide pupils to apply systematic thinking
routines and a range of heuristic strategies, enabling them to analyse
problems, explore possible solutions and solve mathematics problems.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Inquiry- based Learning</h3>
<p>Through Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL), pupils are presented with problem
situations and encouraged to explore ideas and patterns to find solutions.
Teachers carefully sequence and facilitate class discussions, guiding pupils
as they co-construct their understanding of mathematical concepts. This
approach nurtures critical, adaptive, and inventive thinking, while helping
pupils appreciate the relevance of Mathematics in real-life contexts.</p>

<h3>Outdoor and Home-based Learning Experiences</h3>
<p>We also extend learning beyond the classroom doors for pupils to apply
mathematical concepts in real world context. These meaningful activities
nurture an appreciation of how Mathematics is all around us.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Technological Explorations</h3>
<p>Teachers design Student Learning Space (SLS) lessons and integrate interactive
digital manipulatives to help pupils visualise abstract mathematical concepts
and receive instant feedback on their learning. Technology also allows
pupils to collaborate seamlessly and learn at their own pace, deepening
their understanding and making Mathematics lessons more engaging and meaningful.</p>
