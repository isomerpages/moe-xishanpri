# **Mathematics**

**Vision:** Every pupil an **effective** and **confident** problem-solver

**Mission:** To cultivate **an inquiring mind** and to develop **mathematical reasoning** in problem solving

The Mathematics Curriculum in Xishan Primary School is **centred on Problem Solving** with the five key supporting components as illustrated in the pentagon below. We believe that to develop a deep understanding of mathematical concepts, and to make sense of mathematical ideas as well as their connections and applications, our pupils should be exposed to **a variety of learning experiences** including hands-on activities and technological explorations. Our curriculum is focused on **building strong fundamentals** as the basis for cultivating an inquiring mind and developing mathematical reasoning in problem solving.
