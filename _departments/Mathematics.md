# **Mathematics**

**Vision:** Every pupil an **effective** and **confident** problem-solver

**Mission:** To cultivate **an inquiring mind** and to develop **mathematical reasoning** in problem solving

The Mathematics Curriculum in Xishan Primary School is **centred on Problem Solving** with the five key supporting components as illustrated in the pentagon below. We believe that to develop a deep understanding of mathematical concepts, and to make sense of mathematical ideas as well as their connections and applications, our pupils should be exposed to **a variety of learning experiences** including hands-on activities and technological explorations. Our curriculum is focused on **building strong fundamentals** as the basis for cultivating an inquiring mind and developing mathematical reasoning in problem solving.

### Learning Experiences

A variety of learning experiences are integrated into the Mathematics curriculum to make learning fun, meaningful and relevant and to inculcate positive attitudes. Care and attention are given to the design of the learning activities to build confidence in and develop appreciation for Mathematics. In the process, student-centred environment is created to provide an explicit link from visible thinking to abstract thinking.
