**National Education** (NE) is a significant aspect of Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), comprises a wide range of school efforts that help students experience and explore their national identity as Singaporeans, understand the realities and challenges unique to our nation and foster a sense of hope and belonging to Singapore. A strong sense of belonging, reality and hope motivates our students to be active citizens. While they seek to achieve their personal life goals, they also see themselves as playing a contributory role in their families, school, and immediate communities.

#### **NE Commemorative Events**
#### Total Defence Day (TDD)  
Term 1      15 February

###### The theme for 2023 is “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”.
         
15 February marks the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. In commemorating TDD, our students reflect on the importance of Total Defence as Singapore's best all-round response to threats and challenges that confront Singapore (e.g. terrorism, pandemics, cyber-attacks, influence campaigns or economic crises). Students also reflect on the continuing relevance of the six pillars of Total Defence - Military Defence, Civil Defence, Economic Defence, Social Defence, Digital Defence and Psychological Defence - as well as the core message of every Singaporean standing together, each playing our part to protect Singapore and our shared way of life.

TDD is a good opportunity for students in primary school to know the aspects of Total Defence and how they can play a part in each aspect.

* &nbsp;learn that in Singapore, people are treated equally regardless of their race and religion, and

####      National Day Commemoration in School  

Term 3  Last school day before 9 August

###### The theme for 2023 is “Onward As One”.  

It calls upon Singaporeans to look forward confidently and move onward together in building our shared future as one united people.

National Day marks our separation from Malaysia in 1965, and our emergence as an independent country in a community of nations.

The school-based commemoration brings to students a sense of the historical importance and solemnity of National Day. There will be an observance ceremony and a celebrations segment that reflects the National Day theme.

###### 3. Learning at Xishan Heritage Gallery and Heritage Cove
          
Xishan Primary unveiled its extended Heritage Gallery (The Heritage Cove) on Thursday, 28 July 2022. The launch reception was officiated by our SAC Chairperson, Mrs Agnes Sim and members of the SAC.

The original Heritage Gallery was constructed in 2017 to commemorate the school’s 80th anniversary. It provides an overview of the school history, Singapore’s development over the years and the neighbourhood around the school. The heritage gallery was extended and refurbished to showcase the school’s and nation’s transformation over the years. The extension of the gallery allows us to convert the external area into a space for teaching and learning Social Studies and National Education.

Students get to learn about the national symbols by completing the pencil rubbing activities and matching the images to the information about these symbols on the floor visuals. The large Singapore map allows students to practise their map reading skills as they identify the location of the significant places they have read about during Social Studies lessons and visited during their FbL. The newly designed feature wall “Our Journey, Our Hopes” presents the hopes and wishes that Xishanites have penned for their school and nation as well as showcase our journey and our hopes as a school and a nation.

###### 4. Social Studies Field-based Learning (FbL)

Social Studies FbL experiences are planned for Xishanites as listed in the table below. Not only do they provide the opportunity for students to know more about Singapore, they engage them in inquiry-based learning, motivate and sustain their interest in the subject matter as students learn to explore the surroundings, construct new knowledge and make connections to the topic being studied.

P4 to P6 cohort learning journeys are part of the key Student Development Experiences under the CCE Curriculum.
