**National Education** (NE) is a significant aspect of Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), comprises a wide range of school efforts that help students experience and explore their national identity as Singaporeans, understand the realities and challenges unique to our nation and foster a sense of hope and belonging to Singapore. A strong sense of belonging, reality and hope motivates our students to be active citizens. While they seek to achieve their personal life goals, they also see themselves as playing a contributory role in their families, school, and immediate communities.

#### **NE Commemorative Events**
#### Total Defence Day (TDD)  
Term 1      
15 February

###### The theme for 2023 is “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”.
         
15 February marks the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. In commemorating TDD, our students reflect on the importance of Total Defence as Singapore's best all-round response to threats and challenges that confront Singapore (e.g. terrorism, pandemics, cyber-attacks, influence campaigns or economic crises). Students also reflect on the continuing relevance of the six pillars of Total Defence - Military Defence, Civil Defence, Economic Defence, Social Defence, Digital Defence and Psychological Defence - as well as the core message of every Singaporean standing together, each playing our part to protect Singapore and our shared way of life.

TDD is a good opportunity for students in primary school to know the aspects of Total Defence and how they can play a part in each aspect.
