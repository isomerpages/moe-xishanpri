<p><strong>National Education</strong> (NE) is a significant aspect of Character
and Citizenship Education (CCE), comprises a wide range of school efforts
that help students experience and explore their national identity as Singaporeans,
understand the realities and challenges unique to our nation and foster
a sense of hope and belonging to Singapore. A strong sense of belonging,
reality and hope motivates our students to be active citizens. While they
seek to achieve their personal life goals, they also see themselves as
playing a contributory role in their families, school, and immediate communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>NE Commemorative Events</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Total Defence Day (TDD) <br></strong>Term 1 15 February</p>
<p>The theme for 2025 is “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”.</p>
<p>15 February marks the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. In commemorating
TDD, our students reflect on the importance of Total Defence as Singapore's
best all-round response to threats and challenges that confront Singapore
(e.g. terrorism, pandemics, cyber-attacks, influence campaigns or economic
crises). Students also reflect on the continuing relevance of the six pillars
of Total Defence - Military Defence, Civil Defence, Economic Defence, Social
Defence, Digital Defence and Psychological Defence - as well as the core
message of every Singaporean standing together, each playing our part to
protect Singapore and our shared way of life.</p>
<p>TDD is a good opportunity for students in primary school to know the aspects
of Total Defence and how they can play a part in each aspect.</p>
