The Environmental Education at Xishan focuses on the Eco Stewardship Programme which aims to nurture concerned citizens who love and care for the environment by taking mindful and respectful actions. Through the programme, our students will become active agents of environment change who are able to advocate for environmental protection confidently to their peers and the community around them.
