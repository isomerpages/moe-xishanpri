In Xishan Primary School, our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) develops confident leaders through mental skills empowerment and values in action. We believe that **every Xishanite is capable of mastering mental skills to be an effective leader and applying values to contribute and make a difference**. In line with our school’s **Keep CALM and Give framework**, students are given various opportunities to help them become confident leaders with the heart to serve.

### Every Xishanite is a leader who will:

1.  **C**onnect – Build positive relationships and develop a sense of purpose to lead and serve others

2.  Be **A**ctive – Be agents of change imbued with the belief that they can make a difference

3.  Keep **L**earning – Acquire mental skills to strengthen their leadership competencies

4.  Be **M**indful – Develop strong awareness and demonstrate empathy when serving others

5.  **Give** – Contribute meaningfully by serving their peers, the school or the community
