### Art Curriculum

In Xishan, we aim to develop Xishanites to be confident in expressing himself visually and verbally. Experiences within and beyond the classroom are intentionally created.   

### Experiences within the classroom

Art discussion is an essential part of art lesson. It enriches and deepens students’ learning of art. In this video, a group of students acted out a scene in the artwork, ‘Life by the River (Liu Kang, 1975)’.  Two acted as villagers chopping down trees to make houses.

Students are also exposed to a range of media. In the picture below, on the left, students were exploring making forms using papers. On the right are works created with various media.

### Experiences beyond the classroom

Art and Music Week (AMW) is a week of celebration of Art and Music. Various activities are carried out to celebrate students’ learning in the Art and Music. For Art, there are assembly talks, activities and exhibition to engage the students. 

During the pandemic, AMW started to go online! Check out one of the online galleries.

### Museum-based learning (MBL)

Museum-based learning (MBL) is one of the platforms to provide engaging and meaningful ways for students to encounter learning art content. Going to the museum also provides an authentic context for the learning of local art. In addition, the experience will develop in students the competencies and dispositions of an Audience.
