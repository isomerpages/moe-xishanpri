<p>Mission: To develop the confidence, passion and love for the English Language
in our pupils</p>
<h3>STELLAR PROGRAMME (Strategies for English Language Learning And Reading)</h3>
<p>The programme aims to strengthen both language and reading skills as well
as promote a positive attitude towards reading in the foundational years
through the use of well-established, learner-centred and developementally
appropriate pedagogical approaches using authentic children’s literature.
At the heart of the STELLAR programme is the belief that enjoyment is a
fundamental aspect of shared reading and writing experiences.</p>
<p>Aligned with the English Language Syllabus 2020, our teaching approach
emphasises multiliteracies, metacognition and inquiry through dialogue.
Digital tools and authentic contexts are woven into lessons where beneficial,
enhancing the educational experience and enabling students to recognise
how their learning applies to life outside school.</p>
<p>Our English Language classroom experiences are structured to cultivate
students as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Empathetic Communicators</strong> who possess the values, dispositions
and skills to listen actively and engage respectfully with diverse perspectives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discerning Readers</strong> who possess broad worldviews by staying
well informed, reflective and self-directed in their use of information;
and are able to distinguish fact from falsehood</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Creative Inquirers</strong> who approach learning with curiosity,
explore ideas deeply and evaluate real-world issues from multiple perspectives.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>At the upper primary levels, STELLAR emphasises enhancing reading and
writing competencies through inquiry-driven approaches including Supported
Reading (SR), KWL (Know-Want to know-Learnt), and the Writing Process Cycle
(WPC). The programme transitions from basic literacy development to cultivating
analytical thinking, text comprehension, and meaningful interaction with
sophisticated literature and contemporary issues.</p>
<p><strong>1. Learning Support Programme (LSP)</strong>
</p>
<p>Founded on the principle that every child can achieve success at their
individual learning pace, the Learning Support Programme offers additional
assistance to selected students in fundamental literacy competencies, enabling
them to participate effectively in mainstream classroom learning. This
specialised early intervention initiative targets students who begin Primary
1 with limited English language and literacy abilities. Student selection
for LSP occurs through a comprehensive screening methodology implemented
at the start of Primary 1.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme (SDR)</strong>
</p>
<p>The School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme represents a two-year
support initiative designed for Primary 3 and 4 students. Participants
are selected through a thorough dyslexia screening procedure conducted
at the end of Primary 2. Trained school staff facilitate the programme
in small group settings, utilising a specialised remediation curriculum
developed by MOE Reading Specialists.</p>
<p><strong>3. Reading Remediation Programme (RRP)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Reading Remediation Programme supports Primary 3, 4 and 5 students

<p><strong><u>P1 Garden Learning Trail</u></strong>

<p>The P1 Garden Learning Trail, organised for Primary 1 students, is a Field-Based
Learning experience featuring a collaborative initiative between the Social
Studies, Green Movement, and English departments.</p>
<p>This interdisciplinary experience aims to help students understand their
relationship with places and develop care for shared spaces whilst building
essential values such as respect, care, and responsibility through Social
Studies learning. This programme raises awareness about sustainability
and supporting biodiversity, encouraging eco-conscious behaviour and fostering
respectful treatment of plants and animals. Students develop their oral
and written language skills through careful observation and description
activities, expanding their vocabulary related to plants, animals, and
emotions while engaging in reflective writing or drawing exercises that
capture their learning experience within the school environment.</p>
