</div>
<p>The primary physical education program aims to give students a variety
of movement experiences to enhance their overall development and set a
foundation for an active lifestyle.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lower primary level: Focuses on mastering
basic motor skills and applying movement concepts for improved performance.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upper primary level: Builds on discrete
skills to tackle complex movements, sequences, and skills application in
various activities and games.</p>
<p>The curriculum offers a diverse range of learning areas to help schools
design a comprehensive physical education program for primary students.
In accordance with the Emerging 21st Century Competencies framework, our
goal is to ensure that every student possesses these essential skills.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Athletics ( from Primary 4)</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dance</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Games &amp; Sports</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gymnastics</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Physical Health &amp; Fitness</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Swimming (by the end of Primary 6)</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outdoor Education</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Key Program</h3>
<h4>Unstructured Play</h4>
<p>Unstructured play—spontaneous and child-led activities without adult rules—is
crucial for primary school children. It boosts cognitive skills like problem-solving
and decision-making, fosters social skills through peer interaction, enhances
physical fitness and coordination, and supports emotional well-being by
allowing kids to manage stress and build resilience. Embracing this free
play nurtures well-rounded development, setting the stage for academic
success and lifelong health.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rise to Shine -&nbsp;With the intention to get
students to rise early to shine for the rest of the day with enthusiasm
and motivation, the ‘Rise to Shine’ program is put in place to encourage
students to embrace the opportunities to shine and succeed. It's a program
that aims to empower students and help them unlock their full potential
each morning. The students are rotated between the Parade Square, School
Field and Sheltered Basketball Court throughout the week.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recess Play - During recess, students can engage
in a variety of activities, socializing with peers. It's a time for them
to have fun, stay active, and develop important social skills through interaction
and play. The Playground (only for P1 to P3), Parade Square and School
Field is available during Recess Play.</p>

<p>In 2019, our Principal, Mrs. Quek, launched the Grat-uation Run, a meaningful
event that marks a significant milestone for our graduating students.</p>
<p>This initiative aims to impart valuable lessons to our students, emphasizing
that it's not about the speed at which we progress or how well we start,
nor is it about comparing ourselves to others. Rather, it's about finding
purpose and meaning in our journey.</p>
<p>During the run, which takes place within our school compound, students
jog down memory lane alongside their peers, reflecting on their time at
Xishan Primary School and feeling grateful for the experiences and memories
they've shared.</p>
