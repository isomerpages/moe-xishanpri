<p><sup>Adapted from 2024 Physical Education Syllabus</sup>
</p>
<p>The Primary Physical Education programme provides students with a broad
range of movement experiences to support holistic development and lay a
strong foundation for lifelong physical activity.</p>
<p>• <strong>Lower Primary:</strong> Emphasises the development of fundamental
motor skills and the understanding of basic movement concepts to improve
movement performance.</p>
<p>• <strong>Upper Primary:</strong> Builds on these foundations by challenging
students with more complex movements, sequences, and the application of
skills across a variety of activities and games.</p>
<p>Beyond physical skills and game understanding, Physical Education lessons
also offer rich opportunities for students to develop sportsmanship values
such as teamwork, respect, and fair play.</p>

<h3><strong>P6 Graduation Run</strong></h3>
<p>The Graduation Run aims to impart valuable lessons to our students, emphasising
that it's not about the speed at which they progress or how well they start.
Rather, it's about finding purpose and meaning in their journey.</p>
<p>During the run, which takes place within our school compound, students
jog down memory lane alongside their peers, reflecting on their time at
Xishan Primary School and memories they have shared.</p>
