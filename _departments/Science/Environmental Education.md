<h3>Environment Education</h3>
<p>The Environmental Education at Xishan focuses on the Eco Stewardship Programme
which aims to nurture concerned citizens who love and care for the environment
by taking mindful and respectful actions. Through the programme, our students
will become active agents of environment change who are able to advocate
for environmental protection confidently to their peers and the community
around them.</p>
<h5>Four Domains in Environment Education @XPS</h5>
<p>There are four different domains in Environment Education at Xishan. Together,
they provide our students with a holistic understanding and application
of all aspects of Environmental Education.</p>

<h5>Tiered Approach</h5>
<p>The school adopts a three-tiered approach in promoting Eco Stewardship.</p>
<h5>Tier 1 – Engage</h5>
<p>Tier 1 initiatives engage the students in acquiring environmental sustainability
concepts and values on the various environmental topics through assembly
or Form Teachers’ sharing. Every student will be provided with the opportunity
to participate in Tier 1 initiatives such as Recycle Right Campaign, World
Water Day and Clean Plate Campaign. Tier 1 initiatives aim to raise awareness
towards environmental conservation and protection as well as to encourage
the students to adopt responsible sustainability habits for life. For instance,
the briefing on the ‘Green Etiquette’ aims to promote positive environmental
habits and values.</p>

<h5>Tier 2 – Enrich</h5>
<p>Tier 2 initiatives provide learning opportunities for selected levels
to enrich their learning through school-based initiatives and lesson packages.
Learning is hands-on, meaningful and authentic for the students. Tier 2
initiatives include vermicomposting workshop as part of Primary 3 ALP IPW
and The Mindful Blooms (orchid trail) where the students are involved in
simple eco activities to nurture environmentally sustainable habits.</p>

<h5>Tier 3 – Empower</h5>
<p>Tier 3 initiatives target a smaller group of students such as the class
Environment Ambassadors, Environment Club members, selected or interested
students who are keen to advocate for environment sustainability and inspire
others to act. These students suggested and implemented projects that promote
sustainability, conservation and promotion of biodiversity, and environmental
awareness. Throughout the project implementation process, the students
develop creative and critical thinking skills as well as get to hone their
leadership and teamwork skills.</p>

<h5>Alignment with Singapore Green Plan 2030</h5>
<p>As part of our continued efforts under the Singapore Green Plan 2030,
Xishan builds the current environmental efforts through the 4Cs (Curriculum,
Culture, Community and Campus).</p>
<p>a)&nbsp; <strong>Curriculum</strong> – To enhance the teaching and learning
of sustainability concepts through Languages, Science and Social Studies.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;<strong>Culture</strong>- To strengthen the importance of sustainability
as an integral part of our culture. Students and staff are encouraged to
adopt sustainability and eco-mindfulness habits.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp; <strong>Community</strong> - To leverage on community partnerships
to expand environment-related volunteering and learning opportunities.</p>
<p>d)&nbsp; <strong>Campus</strong> - To support the move to reduce net carbon
emissions in schools, sustainability features have been put in place whenever
possible. For e.g. installation of solar panels and rainwater collection
at Xishan’s Greenhouse.</p>
<p>Through these environmental programmes and efforts, Xishan hopes to transform
the way the students perceive environmental issues and start them on the
journey in becoming eco guardians who are ready to protect biodiversity
and advocate for eco sustainability.</p>
